## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Code follows the project's coding standards
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and descriptive
- [ ] Branch is up to date with `main`

### PR Guidelines

1. **Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title
2. **Description**: Explain what changes you made and why
3. **Link issues**: Reference related issues using `Fixes #123`
4. **Screenshots**: Include screenshots for UI changes
5. **Testing**: Describe how you tested your changes

### Review Process

- All PRs require at least one review from a maintainer
- Address feedback promptly and professionally
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Be patient - reviews take time

## Coding Standards

### Go Backend

- Follow [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- Use `gofmt` and `golint`
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and complex logic
- Handle errors appropriately

```go
// Good
func GetUserByID(id string) (*User, error) {
    if id == "" {
        return nil, errors.New("user ID cannot be empty")
    }
    // Implementation...
}
```

### TypeScript Frontend

- Follow [TypeScript ESLint rules](https://typescript-eslint.io/)
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Add TypeScript types for all props and state

```typescript
// Good
interface UserProfileProps {
  user: User;
  onUpdate: (user: User) => void;
}

const UserProfile: React.FC<UserProfileProps> = ({ user, onUpdate }) => {
  // Implementation...
};
```

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Examples:
- `feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication`
- `fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
- `test(user): add unit tests for user service`
