## 🚀 Overview

MCPBOX is an open-source MCP service management platform designed to help users efficiently manage and organize MCP services. As a mid- and back-end product, MCPBOX supports converting MCP's stdio configuration protocol to the SSE configuration protocol, making it easier for administrators to distribute these protocols to other users. It also incorporates a unique token verification mechanism to ensure secure and controllable use.
